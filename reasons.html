    MY REASONS FOR CHOOSING TO  STUDY THIS COURSE.
</h1>
 <P>
    <h2>Intresting and Easy to learn</h2> 

Web development involves creating websites hosted through the internet or intranet. 
It not just involves creating the website but also involves web designing, implementation,
and maintenance. If you are a fresher and looking to carve an amazing IT career, you can choose 
to become a web developer.
You would only require two basic things to start it,
 one is an internet connection and the other is a good laptop.
  You are required to know coding and basic scripting languages like CSS, Javascript, HTML, 
  etc. to create flawless responsive websites and pages. At some point in your career,
   you might also need knowledge of programming languages like Java, Python, etc. 
   Most of the programming languages are open source and can be learned easily.



    <h3>Creative & Expanding field</h3>

Being well developed, you have all the power to express yourself
 creatively and craft cool things on the internet. If you have the
  idea of a new website layout, what’s stopping you from giving it a try?
   It will only hone your web development skills. Undoubtedly, knowledge 
   about web development offers a fun and creative experience. With current 
   advancements in technology and the internet, web development is playing a bigger
    role than ever before.



    <h4> Lot of Freelance Opportunities</h4>

    As a successful freelance web developer, you are pretty much your own boss.
     There are many perks of being self-employed. You get to choose when and where 
     in the world you want to work as well as which clients you want to work with and 
     various other factors that contribute to your happiness while at work, such as how much
      you’re willing to earn and how long you feel comfortable working at a time. This all
       contributes towards establishing your flexible schedule.
       You can also network with other experts on the Internet and build trust relationship
        with them so that they can help one another out whenever necessary since all freelance
         web developers will undoubtedly have something of value to share that could benefit
          everyone involved! Because you’ll be dealing from home rather than an office 
          environment, it will also save accommodations for hotel rent, restaurant meals, etc.
         
<h5> To Sum up:</h5>
          Web development presents a lot of opportunities that you might not have thought about
           before. There is freedom in the fact that you can create things from scratch and 
           bring your ideas to life, but getting there is going to require an investment in
            time and energy. As a web developer, you get the opportunity to explore new careers
             with the confidence of knowing that you’re marketable — finding jobs all over the 
             tech industry. In any case, learning web development will only open more doors for
              opportunities to come knocking at your door.
